# TickTock
An easy to use presentation timer written in Python and Qt.

## Installation

First, make sure that you have the PySide Qt bindings installed for your
platform. They can be downloaded for multiple operating systems from 
[here](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Downloads).

Once you have those set up, clone this git repository and run ticktock.py. It's
as easy as that!
